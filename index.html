                        <p>
                            Hello, I am kwstn, programmer extraordinaire from CYP to NL
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have had significant software development experience during my studies
                            at university. I particularly enjoyed using Unity-3d for game design as well 
                            as the exposure to cybersecurity. Having also been involved in developing a 
                            self-driving/parking vehicle project utilising Lego leJOS & NXT software.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to this I have also worked in a group development that created a 
                            restaurant system that allows customers to order food and staff to track and process those orders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am very confident with any level of mathematics. 
                            I have studied mathematics through GCSE, AS and degree level. My degree course combined mathematics and computer science 
                            allowing me to become well proficient in programming and mathematical problem solving. I am able to pick up new mathematical 
                            concepts with ease and understand how to implement them to different situations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another experience was with Sony where I worked in various departments getting to 
                            understand both day-to-day operations and administrative tasks. I was also involved in their game 
                            testing program and gained valuable insight into their processes and standards of operation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my spare time I am an avid football fan, having supported Arsenal FC all my life, I loves 
                            getting to go to the Emirates Stadium to watch my favourite team.
                        </p>
